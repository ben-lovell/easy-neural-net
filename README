This is a powerful neural net built for people who are entry-level coders in Python. It is designed to be easily accessible, only requiring a user to change variables and file locations to make use of it. Most of the variables should be defined in the Neural_Net.py file.

GETTING STARTED
Download both files, and pip install numpy and sklearn. From there, simply change the appropriate variables for file locations and adjust the neural net training parameters in Neural_Net.py. Data sets should be in CSV format with the first column(s) being the output variables you would like to predict.

Highlights of this configuration include:
  - save and re-use previous neural nets
  - automatic detection of variables
  - 2 hidden layers of adjustable neurons
  
I will be updating the code periodically, so please comment any suggestions / questions and I will get to them as quickly as I can.
