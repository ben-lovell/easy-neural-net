This is a neural net that built for people who are entry-level coders, to use. It is designed to be easily accessible,
only requiring easy to make variable changes.

Download both files, and pip install numpy and sklearn. From there, simply change the appropriate variables for file
locations and adjust the neural net training parameters. 

Most of the variables should be defined in the Neural_Net.py file.

Highlights of this configuration include:
  - save and re-use previous neural nets
  - automatic detection of variables
  - 2 hidden layers of adjustable neurons
  
I will be updating the code periodically, so please comment any suggestions / questions 
and I will get to them as quickly as I can.
